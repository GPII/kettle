Kettle.
===

Kettle is the Fluid Project's experimental server-side platform, based on node.js and [express](http://expressjs.com/)

The homepage for Kettle is at http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Kettle, with issue tracking at http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/KETTLE .

Kettle operates by executing [Fluid Infusion](http://www.fluidproject.org/products/infusion/) and a very minimal profile of jQuery on the server-side.

Kettle apps

More documentation will be forthcoming - in the meantime please join us in #fluid-tech on irc.freenode.net .
