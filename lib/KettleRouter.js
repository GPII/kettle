 * @member {String} [route] - A routing specification in the traditional format for express routes, e.g. of the form

 * @member {String} [method] - An HTTP method specification, possibly including multiple comma-separated values

 *           expression must match the incoming request in order for this handler to be activated
 * @member {String[]} gradeNames - One or more grade names which will be mixed in to the constructed handler when it is constructed.
